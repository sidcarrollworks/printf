# Simulation of the C Standard Library printf Funnction
## Sid Carroll & Cam Moore
### _printf.c
This is a project that simulates the C library function `printf`. Our simulation _printf is a variadic function which formats arguments into a character string and sends the formatted output to `stdout`. 

## Overview of Repository
`holberton.h` - Header file containing directives and function prototypes
`helper_funcs.c` - Source file containing functions used for data manipulation
`print_functions.c` - Source file containing functions used for printing data
`_printf.c` - Source file containing code that simulates the printf function
